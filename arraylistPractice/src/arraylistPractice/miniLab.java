/* Create a method that will receive an integer parameter and then return an ArrayList that 
 * contains all of the numberâ€™s factors, excluding 1 and itself.  

Create a 2nd method that will remove all numbers from its ArrayList parameter that are not 
composite numbers.  Composite numbers are divisible by 1, itself, and must have at least 1 other 
positive factor.  You will need to use % to determine if a number is a factor.  While you will 
want to create a main method for testing, you only need to hand in the completed methods of the 
class as shown below.
